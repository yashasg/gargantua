/// Sequential multi-adapter scan pipeline.
///
/// Composes `ScanAdapter` conformers (`NativeScanAdapter`, `CzkawkaAdapter`,
/// `FclonesAdapter`, …) into a single `ScanAdapter` facade so views can treat
/// "the scan engine" as one opaque adapter regardless of how many backends
/// feed it.
///
/// Adapters are invoked in the order supplied and awaited one at a time to
/// satisfy PRD §8.4 "Sequential pipeline by default — never run fclones +
/// czkawka + native scanner simultaneously". `ScanEngine` never uses
/// `async let` or a `TaskGroup`; parallelism across adapters is an explicit
/// non-goal here.
///
/// Results from every adapter are concatenated in adapter order. Each adapter
/// is responsible for its own Trust Layer defaults — `ScanEngine` does not
/// re-classify results, so duplicate review-by-default semantics from
/// `FclonesAdapter` carry through unchanged.
///
/// ## Known limitation: shared `ScanProgress` across multiple adapters
///
/// The `ScanProgress` argument is forwarded to each child adapter as-is.
/// Adapters currently call `progress.start()` / `progress.finish()`
/// themselves, so with `n > 1` adapters the aggregate `fractionCompleted`
/// and `itemsFound` values oscillate instead of rising monotonically, and
/// `isScanning` flickers false between adapter boundaries. This is
/// acceptable for the current single-adapter duplicate-finder pipeline;
/// multi-adapter UIs (e.g. Deep Clean composing native + czkawka) should
/// either pass `nil` for `progress` to each child and synthesise
/// aggregate progress here, or give each child its own `ScanProgress`.
